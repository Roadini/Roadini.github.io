title: The Initial Work Plan

---

In the class of service engineering, the objective is to develop an idea who follows and Service Oriented Architectures approach, therefore, we start to break our idea in services and distributing this services to the team.
Our principal modules are: 
* **Social Network/Authentication** will be built by jõao branquinho and his service needs to offer a lot of functionalities like creating users, login, manage friends and other things related to social network.
* **Geo/Clustering** this service is related to localization, so, needs to manage the creation and history of places, routes, and all information pertinent. This service still offers an artificial intelligence functionality who help to plan trips effortlessly. Will be developed by Luís Silva.
* **Notification** like the name of the service tells, this service is responsible for notifications of the users, they will receive these notifications when receiving likes or commentaries in his routes for example. Gabriel Patrício is the man of this service.
* **CDN/Image Recognition** the purpose of the first part of this service, Content Delivery Network, is to save all images in the application from users to locations. Everything is content to be saved, which will be consumed by the RoadIni application. The second part is the Image Recognition which is a feature of our app, if we take a photo of a monument this service recognize it and gives some information about it. This service will be created by João Maia.
* **Composer** This is the central service who will call all of the other services to provide information and content which be used in the application. Furthermore, the person responsible for this part, Tiago Ramalho, also needs to develop the application itself.

After this distribution, the goal by the end of the week was to define the main languages for each service and in some cases the communication endpoints as well.
All of us reach the goal? Not really, only two elements pleased the teacher, Luís Silva because he brought a well-think API and Tiago Ramalho who did not need to bring an API defined but some endpoints who he will need. He also made the first mockup! The others elements or didn't define the API or didn't think in his service or the work just wasn't good enough to the teacher.
