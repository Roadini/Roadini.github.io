title: The next big thing

First of all **Hello!**, 

Before I tell you guys the early begin of the project I will present our team, at the time of this post, the team are all students of Computer and Telematics Engineering:
  * Tiago Ramalho aka **The Player**
  * Luís Silva aka **The Associative**
  * João Branquinho aka **The Fat**
  * Gabriel Patrício aka **The Dealer** 
  * João Maia aka **The SheepFaced**

This brilliant idea was thought in Project Management and entrepreneurship class with two more colleagues Raquel Ramos and Silvério Pereira.  For the class, the professors asked for one project which was an innovation, globally need and could be a startup which eventually will raise millions for us. We had a lot of ideas but this was the best:
  > **A social network for all the people who love travel. Where we can plan the trip effortlessly, have the best experiences in the places which will we visit and share that amazing trip with friends**

After that we thought in a lot of cases where the people could use our application and why should they use, on that week we took our final decision for the project and we introduce it in other class of our course, service engineering. In this class we made this team to develop the greatest application for travelers.
