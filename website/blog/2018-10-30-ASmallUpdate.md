title: A Small Update
---

The catastrophy! The tragedy!

Due to the devastating amount of work this week, our progress was not that much. But there's no need for worries! Now we are more determined than ever to complete this project and score that 20 grade!

Yesterday, our colleague <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ofantasticoluis">Luís Silva</a> presented the project in the course of Project Management and Entrepreneurship, with a positive feedback from the teacher. Now we are more encouraged to continue our work!

Our next step will be to finish our endpoints and test them. Some of us are already testing their implementations, others are still developing. In my case, i already have the endpoints for the CDN service defined and only need to be tested, however the endpoints for the image recognition still need to be implemented and therefore tested :(

With nothing more to report, until our next update!
