Hey hey hey!
Yeah I know I keep repeating my self.
No, it's not a condition.

We the developers had a busy week. There was another course needing our attention.
The main changes during this week were on the endpoints. I, for example, started a database for my authentication and social service. Before this, I also created test dummies to all of my endpoints so that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiago.ramalho.319">Tiago Ramalho</a>  could develop the app having a probing reference.

On a more business-oriented note, take a look to a draft of our brand new business model.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roadini/Roadini.github.io/source/           website/static/img/buisness1.pdf">

This was a start to what is called "The Business Model Canvas".
Now we a better-defined conception of how we want to develop as we grow as a startup. Besides the basic idea, which is an app that helps tourists travel through a new city, creating new routes and having their friends' routes as a guide, we also thought of two new key value propositions:

* The gathering of statistics. This feature can be helpful to the Town Hall in order for a better understanding of the current trends.
* The creation of a new advertising place to the local tourism. A better way to reach targeted users.

We intend to focus on advertisements to the main public has a way to pay for our expenses. This is a common model that social networks tend to follow.

For now, the app/services development will focus on the basic idea. Non the less the definition the business plans for a near/middling future is important for a better focus on the main business targets.
