title: Service Oriented Architectures are Awful
---

We start this week by taking a step back and getting a good look into the state of our project. We knew the objective of the course was to build a project with a Service Oriented Approach to the problem. With that in mind we start by giving each other a task or better said a Service.

After a whole week has passed on which each one of us worked on his Service, there it was, the time to talk, to gather around and see the state of our project.

Fu\*\*!

In the week that passed, we all started to run in different directions, and our services were the mirror to that.

Some of us, start writing code diving blindly into this project. Others where dwelling with a new technology that they were exploring ( Damn You XMPP ). Others more conservative only write down the APIs that they were expecting to expose, but even those careful players were overwhelmed by how far their ideas were from the other team members.

So, why SOA is awful? Well, we packed the rest of this week with discussions about how to implement this goddamned project. 

It all started with a simple ID, who should store the USER_ID? The composer? But the composer does not have a database? Ok, but if the Composer doesn't store the ID, how can I have access to it? I will send it to you? But how do you know? I ask for it. But maybe you shouldn't store the USER_ID? But then how could I know who it was this from? But if you are a service, why should you know my users? But if I don't how can I store the information?

All in all, it was a jungle the entire week. We are still trying to emerge firms and ready for the next one, but this took a toll on us. But is SOA bad?

Not at all, at his core, it is still a pretty handy solution with an interesting approach to a problem. We all know that
